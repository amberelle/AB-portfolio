<h5>
I recently graduated from Epicodus Code School where I studied development and design including classes like advanced CSS, Javascript, and Design.  I have an interest and passion for good user experience and building great looking sites that make sense.

<h5>
  My whole life, I’ve had difficulty focusing on one field until now.  My background and interests have varied pretty wildly.  In my previous life I have been an Army Intelligence Analyst, a Lab Tech at many blood centers, and an Audio Technician for an ABC News Affiliate, but I never felt any of those truly suited me.  It wasn’t until I met someone on a mountain biking trip who was an Epicodus Alumni that I even realized what coding was and how accessible it was to learn.  Since deciding to do the design route at school I finally feel truly excited about a career path.  I love the creativity involved in front end development and design as well as the almost unlimited possibilities for new education, growth, and job potential.

<h5>
Good music, adventure sports, and great web design make me happy.
